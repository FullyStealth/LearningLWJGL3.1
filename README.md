# LearningLWJGL3.1
#Info
This code was made while following ElegantWhelp's Youtube LWJGL 3 tutorial, so credit goes to him for teaching me how to display anything on the screen ;D
There is only two main differences between my code and ElegantWhelp's:
- I am using LWJGL 3.1 instead of the normal 3 (It works the same except for the few *GL_TRUE*'s that I had to change to *true*)
- The bug.
The issue is that once I add the "test2" tile which has the checkered texture, all the tiles on the screen turn to that tile.

#Note to ElegantWhelp:
Keep up the great work! :D
